# QueueDataStructure
This program creates a queue data structure that holds characters. The main method tests the queue by inserting random characters into the queue, displaying the front of the queue, and removing elements from the queue. The queue is implemented using an array, and the program prevents the user from inserting more elements once the queue is full.
